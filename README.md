# structuredData (sd)

A library for the famous [puredata](https://puredata.info/) music software.

## purpose

This library shows one flavour of writing abstractions/patches in puredata and how to exchange specifically structured messages between them.

In more detail: The library provides utilities to realize specific design principles in puredata, namely:

- structured messages

	- hierarchically structured, arbitrarily deeply nested messages 
	- these can be accumulated, serialized, filtered, ...

- objects maintaining internal state

	- a stateful object has "properties"
	- properties can be set/retrieved in a standardized way

The goals/benefits are:

- record all "events" happening at runtime
- stateful objs can track other objects state
- the state of an object can be saved/loaded to/from RAM/disk

## implementation

Most objects are written in C, a few are provided as puredata "abstractions".

## dependencies

- fish shell
- autotools
- structuredData
- other repositories. Please execute:

		$ ./scripts/install_deps.fish

## installation

1. run autotools:

		$ ./scripts/run_autotools.fish

2. build and install:

	build the library:

		$ ./scripts/build.fish build install

	(for options append `--help`)

3. add to pd libraries:

	you have two options:

	- start pd from the command line like this:

			$ pd [-path <install_path>] -lib structuredDataC

	- add this to `~/.pdsettings` :

			...
			loadlib1: structuredDataC
			...

		you might also have to adjust the library search path:

			...
			path1: <install_path>
			...

	(manuall adjust the numbering!)

## other scripts

- uninstall:

		$ ./scripts/build.fish uninstall

- clean all temporary files generated by autotools (this wont uninstall):

		$ ./scripts/clean_autotools.fish

## documentation

The Documentation is provided as puredata example patches.
You can (only) open it by issueing these commands:

(note to self: TODO: automatically install docu with the library)

1. install docu in the local dir

		$ ./scripts/install_doc.fish

2. run docu

		$ ./scripts/run_doc.fish

3. uninstall docu

		$ ./scripts/uninstall_doc.fish
